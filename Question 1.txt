Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
Answer:
HTTP1.1
HTTP1.1, introduced in 1999, revolutionized the way data is transmitted between clients and servers. Despite its groundbreaking nature at the 
time,it has its limitations, particularly when it comes to handling modern web demands. 

Key characteristics of HTTP1.1:
Persistent Connections: In HTTP1.1, persistent connections were introduced to reuse a single connection for multiple requests and responses, and
this still led to head-of-line blocking, where one slow request could delay others in the pipeline.

Resource Bundling: To reduce the overhead of multiple requests, developers often bundled resources like scripts and stylesheets into a single 
file and helped mitigate the number of requests, it led to inefficiencies and decreased cacheability.

Blocking and Prioritization: Browsers could only fetch resources in a serial manner, causing delays when a higher-priority resource was 
held up by a lower-priority one.

HTTP2
Introduced in 2015, HTTP2 aimed to address the shortcomings of its predecessor and deliver a more efficient and responsive web experience. 

Key features of HTTP2:
Multiplexing: One of the most significant improvements is multiplexing, which allows multiple requests and responses to be sent over a single 
connection simultaneously. This eliminates head-of-line blocking and significantly improves page loading times.

Binary Protocol: HTTP2 employs a binary framing layer instead of the text-based protocol of HTTP1.1. This results in more 
efficient parsing and reduced overhead, enhancing overall performance

Header Compression: HTTP2 employs HPACK, a header compression algorithm, to reduce the size of headers. This helps conserve bandwidth 
and speeds up page loading

Server Push: HTTP2 introduces server push, which enables the server to proactively send resources to the client before they are requested.
This reduces the need for additional round-trip requests and accelerates page rendering

Prioritization: HTTP/2 allows developers to assign priorities to resources, ensuring that higher-priority resources are fetched and loaded before 
lower-priority ones. This improves the overall user experience
