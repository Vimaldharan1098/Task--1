Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

Answer:

JavaScript, objects are the backbone of the language, enabling developers to create, manipulate, and structure data in a versatile and 
dynamic manner

JavaScript object is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is a string (or a symbol) that maps to a value. These values can be of any 
data type, including numbers, strings, arrays, objects, functions. Objects in JavaScript can be created using various methods, including 
object literals, constructor functions, and classes.

Internal Representation of Objects
To understand how JavaScript handles objects internally, let's explore two crucial concepts: reference and memory management.

Reference
JavaScript, when you create an object and assign it to a variable, what you're actually storing in that variable is a reference to the object's 
location in memory. This means that multiple variables can point to the same object, allowing for efficient memory usage and data manipulation. 
However, it's essential to note that primitive values are stored directly in variables, whereas objects are stored by reference

Memory Management
JavaScript engines utilize a process called garbage collection to manage memory. Garbage collection automatically identifies and recycles memory 
that is no longer in use, ensuring optimal memory usage and preventing memory leaks. When an object is no longer reachable it becomes eligible for 
garbage collection, freeing up memory for other operations
